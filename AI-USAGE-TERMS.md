# AI Usage Terms & Intellectual Property

## Ownership & Control

All code, specifications, and systems generated through DevMatrix are **owned exclusively by you**. DevMatrix retains no rights, claims, or access to your generated applications or data.

## Data & Privacy

- Your specifications and generated systems are **not used for training** DevMatrix models or any third-party systems.
- No telemetry, usage patterns, or system internals are collected for model improvement.
- All processing occurs within controlled infrastructure with no external data sharing.

## Reproducibility & Determinism

DevMatrix operates on deterministic compilation principles:

- The same specification, compiled through the same compiler version, produces **bit-identical output**.
- All generated systems are **auditable and reproducible**.
- No stochastic elements or probabilistic outputs affect your generated code.

## Intellectual Property Rights

- **Your specifications remain yours.** DevMatrix does not claim ownership of problem domains, architectures, or business logic you provide.
- **Generated code is yours.** All source code, infrastructure definitions, and deployment configurations are your property.
- **No licensing restrictions.** You may use, modify, distribute, or commercialize generated systems without restrictions or royalties.

## Responsible AI Principles

DevMatrix is designed with the following commitments:

- **No hallucinations by design.** The compiler validates all outputs against specifications before generation.
- **Transparency.** All compilation passes and validation steps are auditable.
- **No hidden dependencies.** Generated systems have no runtime dependencies on DevMatrix infrastructure.

## Limitations & Disclaimers

DevMatrix is provided as a compiler tool. Like all software systems:

- Generated code should be reviewed and tested before production deployment.
- DevMatrix does not guarantee bug-free output, though it applies systematic validation.
- You are responsible for security, compliance, and operational aspects of deployed systems.

## Changes to These Terms

These terms may be updated. Continued use of DevMatrix constitutes acceptance of current terms.
